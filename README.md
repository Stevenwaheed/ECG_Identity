<h1 align="center" id="title">ECG_Identity</h1>

<p id="description">Using ECG Heart Biometrics to identify people through their unique heart wave signals. The heartbeats are relatively changeable as they change in fixed patterns according to the different activities that the person performs. I train a machine learning model with my team ecg signals so the predicts of the uploaded model with be their names.</p>
